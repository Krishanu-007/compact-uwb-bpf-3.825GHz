# üìò 7th Order Harmonic Rejection Filter (HRF)

## üéØ Why This Was Needed

The final 5th-order Band Pass Filter (BPF) designed using open-stub topology, although optimized in terms of size and return/insertion loss, **suffered from extra passbands beyond the desired upper cutoff (5.025 GHz)**. These are higher-order harmonics resulting from the non-ideal response of the open-stub design, typically appearing near **3f‚ÇÄ/2 (‚âà 5.7 GHz)** and beyond.

To comply with the specification of **>25 dBc stopband rejection between 5.55 GHz and 17.25 GHz**, a **Harmonic Rejection Filter (HRF)** was designed and added **in cascade** with the BPF.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Theoretical Design Approach

- **Filter Type**: Elliptic Low-Pass (to realize sharp roll-off and equiripple stopband)
- **Response Objective**:
  - 3 dB cutoff near **5.3 GHz**
  - ‚â•30 dB attenuation at **6.2 GHz**
  - Minimal ripple (~0.1 dB) in passband
- **Order**: 7th order (selected after theoretical analysis)
- **Element Mapping**:
  - High impedance (90 Œ© ‚Üí 0.12 mm width): represents **series inductive behavior**
  - Low impedance (20 Œ© ‚Üí 1.96 mm width): represents **shunt capacitive behavior**
- **Design Calculations**:
  - Œªg and Œµ<sub>eff</sub> computed using ADS LineCalc
  - Lengths calculated using standard microstrip inductor/capacitor transformation formulae

## üß™ Practical Approach and Tuning

After schematic simulation, the filter‚Äôs 3 dB cutoff **shifted from 5.3 GHz to 6.3 GHz**. To correct this, all computed line lengths were **scaled using a factor ‚Äòm‚Äô**, derived from the ratio of desired-to-actual cutoff frequencies.

The corrected layout was then simulated for S-parameters.

## üß± Layout View

The physical implementation used:

- Microstrip layout with **series Œªg/4 connecting lines wtih Œªg/4 and Œªg/2 stubs in series**, this is actually a dual representation for elliptic filter response design
- Manual routing to maintain electrical lengths while folding geometry
- Gold conductor, 25 mil Alumina substrate (Œµr = 9.9)

## üîß Co-Simulation with BPF

Two impedance matching methods were evaluated to connect the HRF to the BPF:

### üî∏ Method 1: T-Section Matching
- Standard L-network between BPF and HRF
- Improved transition without much layout complexity

**Schematic:**

**S-Parameter Response:**

### üî∏ Method 2: Stepped Impedance Transformer
- Broader matching, but slightly bulky in layout

**S-Parameter Response:**

üìå Final integration used a **10 mm long, 0.6 mm wide microstrip** to connect the two sections due to **area constraint violations by both networks**:

## üîç Observations

- **Schematic Design**: Required tuning due to frequency shift
- **Layout Simulation**:
  - Verified all electrical and geometric specs
  - EM simulation confirmed expected elliptic behavior and harmonic suppression
- **Compact Integration**: Successfully fits substrate limit and integrates with 5th-order BPF

‚úÖ **The HRF eliminates the unwanted passbands beyond 5.025 GHz**, helping meet the NEB and stopband suppression constraints when cascaded with the BPF.
